In times of turmoil, when the world seems bleak,
And hope is lost amidst the endless strife,
We seek a light to guide us as we seek
To find a path that leads us back to life.

For though the darkness may seem all-consuming,
And shadows loom on every side we turn,
We must remember that the sun is blooming,
And soon its rays will make our spirits burn.

So let us keep our faith and persevere,
For though the road ahead may be unclear,
We know that hope and love will conquer fear,
And lead us to a brighter, better year.

And when we reach the end of this long fight,
We'll find that joy and peace were worth the plight.
